# Inflation Rate Analysis vs Unemployment rate

## Intro : In this project, I set out to visualize and analyze inflation in the United States, and attempt to understand if there is correlation with unemployement. What happens to inflation when unemployement rate goes up or down. 

### Understanding Inflation

I took a deep dive into what Inflation is, and what types of factors may be related to inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the value of the USD falls, hence the amount of "stuff" one dollar can buy decreases. It is common to use the change in Consumer Price Index or Producer Price Index to mark inflation. 

Consumer Price Index (CPI) - measure the price of a selection of goods and services for a typical consumer.

Producer Price Index (PPI) â€“ measures the prices for all goods and services at the wholesale level. It is like the consumer price index but it is measuring the prices the producers have to pay.

## Results
While working on this project I set my goal to see a relation between Inflation and Unemployment, specially in five time periods that I think were important and impactuful in the history of the United States these were; The Great Depresion, WW2, Abandoning the Gold Standard, Great Recession and COVID-19.

We can see how there is a some inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. Whenever we see spikes in unemployment the inflation rate goes down. We can see the more specifically during the great recession. 

This is very important to understand because inflation affects all aspects of the economy, from consumer spending, business investment and employment rates to government programs, tax policies, and interest rates which control economic growth.
